# Tiger.in.Haskell
Modern Compiler Implementation in Haskell. An interpreter for Tiger programming language.

## Chapter 1: Introduction

In this secton, you'll be asked to write a simple interpreter for a straight-line programming language.

There're 2 tasks: 
1. Simple recursive one: check the paramters number in Print Statements.
2. Interpreter: Put all the evaluation results in a table.

You could find these 2 functions in /chap1/slp.hs
