#About Haskell Lexical Analysis

In this chapter, we are going to implement a lexer for Tiger language using Haskell. 

It is a common sense that we should use some "lexer-generation" tools for Haskell.
For C we have lex and flex, for ML we have ML-lex. 
And for Haskell, we have [Alex](https://www.haskell.org/alex/) (Maybe one day I could implement one by myself).

##Brief Introduction for Alex
